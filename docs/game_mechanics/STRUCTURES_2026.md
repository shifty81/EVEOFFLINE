# EVE Online 2026 Player-Owned Structures

## Overview

As of early 2026, EVE Online's infrastructure has evolved significantly following the **Equinox** and **Catalyst** expansions, placing a heavy emphasis on dynamic, resource-intensive player-owned structures (POS) and specialized Upwell structures.

The 2026 roadmap, outlined by CCP, features a transition toward **"Theatres of War,"** where structures are central to military campaigns, sovereignty, and specialized industrial activities.

## 1. New Nullsec & Strategic Structures (The "Equinox" Evolution)

Following the Equinox expansion and leading into 2026, nullsec structures are designed to be more **specialized**, forcing corporations to make choices about their strategic focus.

### Orbital Skyhook

**Description**: This is a major structure that acts as a "space elevator" in nullsec.

- Replaces older, less efficient planetary interaction (PI) methods

**Defense:**
- Requires **active management and defense**
- Can be **stolen by opposing players**
- Features "raiding" mechanics where enemies can siphon the resources being harvested
- High-risk, high-reward structure

**Strategic Value:**
- **Economic Impact**: High - provides continuous passive income
- **Defense Priority**: Critical - requires constant vigilance
- **Best For**: Well-defended nullsec systems with active defense fleets

### Sovereignty Hub (Sov Hub)

**Description**: The new central nerve center for nullsec system control.

**Usage:**
- Replaces older, deprecated sovereignty mechanics
- Allows alliances to install upgrades that determine:
  - Types of anomalies that spawn in the system
  - Available sites and resources
  - System capabilities and bonuses

**Customization:**
- Heavily focused on balancing **industrial output** with **defensive capabilities**
- 7 upgrade slots for different strategic focuses:
  - **Industrial**: Mining anomalies, gas sites, ore prospecting
  - **Military**: Combat anomalies, defensive bonuses, cyno jammer
  - **Economic**: Ratting sites, exploration signatures, manufacturing bonuses

**Strategic Value:**
