# EVE OFFLINE - Session Summary: Continue Next Steps

**Date**: February 11, 2026  
**Session Goal**: Continue next steps for EVE OFFLINE project  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Repository Analysis & Assessment

**Analyzed Current State:**
- Reviewed project structure and documentation
- Examined NEXT_TASKS.md and SHIP_GENERATION_NEXT_STEPS.md
- Checked procedural ship generation integration status
- Assessed C++ server implementation

**Key Findings:**
- Project in excellent health with 27 complete game systems
- Procedural ship generation fully integrated into Model class
- 102 ships, 159+ modules, 137 skills implemented
- All baseline systems operational
- 832 test assertions across 170+ test functions

### 2. Build & Test Validation

**C++ Server Build:**
- Successfully built server without OpenGL dependencies
- Build process clean with only expected Steamworks SDK warning
- Binary executable created: `cpp_server/build/bin/eve_dedicated_server`
- Test binary created: `cpp_server/build/bin/test_systems`

**Test Execution Discovery:**
- Found tests fail when run from `build/bin` directory
- Root cause: data file path resolution issue
- Tests successfully pass when run from repository root
- All 832 test assertions passing

### 3. Test Infrastructure Improvements

**Created `cpp_server/run_tests.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test runner that ensures correct execution context
# Automatically changes to repository root before running tests
# Works when called from any directory
```

**Features:**
- Portable execution from any directory
- Clear error messages if test binary not built
- Automatic path resolution to repository root
- Exit code propagation for CI/CD integration
- User-friendly output formatting

**Verification:**
```bash
cd cpp_server && bash run_tests.sh
# Result: 832/832 test assertions passed ✓
```

### 4. Documentation Enhancements

**Added comprehensive testing section:**
- Quick build and test instructions
- Explanation of test runner usage
- Manual test execution guide
- Complete test coverage breakdown by system
- Clarifying note distinguishing test functions from assertions
- Professional documentation format

**Test Coverage Documentation:**

- Added new section 1.2 for test infrastructure
- Documented completion with date

### 5. Code Quality Assurance

**Security Scan:**
- Ran CodeQL checker

- All changes are documentation and scripts

**Code Reviews:**
- Multiple review cycles conducted
- All feedback addressed:
  - Fixed terminology inconsistency (tests vs assertions)
  - Added clarifying note about test metrics
  - Improved documentation clarity
- Final review: No issues remaining

**Test Validation:**
- All 832 test assertions passing

## Technical Details

### Test Execution Environment

**Problem Identified:**
```
cpp_server/build/bin/test_systems
├── Tries ../data       → cpp_server/data (doesn't exist)
├── Tries data          → build/bin/data (doesn't exist)  
└── Tries ../../data    → cpp_server/../data (doesn't exist)
```

**Solution Implemented:**
```bash
# run_tests.sh changes to repository root
cd "$REPO_ROOT"  # Now data/ directory is accessible
./cpp_server/build/bin/test_systems  # Correct path resolution
```
