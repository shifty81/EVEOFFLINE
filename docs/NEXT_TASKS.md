## Decision Framework

When choosing what to work on next, consider:

1. **Impact**: How much does it improve the game?
2. **Effort**: How long will it take?
3. **Risk**: How likely is it to break existing features?
4. **Dependencies**: What needs to be done first?

### High Impact, Low Effort (Do First)
- Documentation improvements
- Simple content additions (ships, modules)
- Bug fixes

### High Impact, High Effort (Plan Carefully)
- New game systems
- Major performance improvements
- Large content expansions

### Low Impact, Low Effort (Nice-to-Have)
- Visual polish
- Minor UI improvements
- Code cleanup

### Low Impact, High Effort (Avoid Unless Necessary)
- Speculative features
- Over-engineering
- Premature optimization

## Conclusion

The EVE OFFLINE project is in excellent shape with all major systems implemented and working. The next steps should focus on:

1. **Short term**: Content expansion (more ships, modules, missions)
2. **Medium term**: Performance optimization and polish
3. **Long term**: Advanced features and community tools

The project has a solid foundation and can grow in multiple directions based on user feedback and priorities.
