# EVE OFFLINE

A PVE-focused space MMO inspired by EVE ONLINE, designed for small groups of players (2-20). Built with a custom Python game engine and inspired by both EVE ONLINE and Astrox Imperium.

## 🎮 Features

- **Custom Game Engine**: Built from scratch using Python with Entity Component System (ECS) architecture
- **Multiplayer PVE**: Server-authoritative multiplayer for cooperative gameplay without PVP
- **EVE-Like Mechanics**: Ships, skills, fitting, combat, missions, and exploration
- **Fully Moddable**: All game content defined in editable JSON files (ships, modules, skills, NPCs, missions)
- **Text-Based Data**: Inspired by Astrox Imperium's modding approach - edit with any text editor
- **Server-Client Architecture**: Dedicated server for persistent worlds

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shifty81/EVEOFFLINE.git
cd EVEOFFLINE

# Optional: Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (optional for enhanced features)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Game

**🎨 NEW! GUI Demo (Visual gameplay - Recommended to see visuals!):**
```bash
python gui_demo.py
```
Graphical demo with pygame showing:
- 2D space visualization with star field
- Visual ship representations with health bars
- Real-time combat with weapon effects
- Interactive camera controls (pan, zoom)
- **No server required** - runs standalone!

**🎮 Interactive Gameplay Demo (Text-based, feature-complete):**
```bash
python interactive_demo.py
```
This provides a menu-driven interface to explore all game features:
- Ship status and fitting
- Drone operations
- Combat and targeting
- Skills and progression
- Navigation and warp
- Missions and scanning

**📺 Automated Gameplay Showcase:**
```bash
python showcase_gameplay.py
```
Demonstrates all features in a scripted format (great for screenshots/videos).

**🌐 Multiplayer Server Mode:**

**Start the server:**
```bash
python server/server.py
```

**Start a text client (in a new terminal):**
```bash
python client/client.py "YourCharacterName"
```

**Or start a GUI client (with visuals):**
```bash
python client/gui_client.py "YourCharacterName"
```

**Start multiple clients for multiplayer:**
```bash
python client/client.py "Pilot1"
python client/gui_client.py "Pilot2"
python client/client.py "Pilot3"
```

- **Universe**: Multiple solar systems connected by stargates

## 🔧 Modding

All game content is moddable via JSON files in the `data/` directory:

```
data/
├── ships/          # Ship definitions
├── modules/        # Module definitions  
├── skills/         # Skill definitions
├── npcs/           # NPC definitions
├── missions/       # Mission templates
└── universe/       # Solar system data
```

See [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for modding guides.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Engine**: Custom Python ECS engine
**Networking**: asyncio with TCP sockets
**Data Format**: JSON for all game data
**Persistence**: SQLite (planned)

**Inspired by:**
- **EVE ONLINE** by CCP Games (game mechanics)
- **Astrox Imperium** by Jace Masula (modding approach, data-driven design)
