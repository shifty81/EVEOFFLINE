    "briefing": "The manifests confirmed our worst fears. The Shadow Pact is not building conventional weapons — they are developing a miniaturized doomsday device, codenamed 'Ashstorm.' If they succeed, any Angel battleship could carry the destructive power of a titan's main gun. The foundry is located in a fortified deadspace complex in Utopia. It is defended by Pact Ascendant-class elite ships and automated defense batteries. I will not lie to you — this will be one of the hardest fights of your career. Destroy the foundry, eliminate the defense fleet, and recover the Ashstorm prototype schematics. If we fail here, the balance of power in the warzone shifts permanently in the Cartel's favor.",

They have completed a working Ashstorm prototype and mounted it on the Pact Ascendant flagship Duskwing, the 'Scorch Apostle.'

The Keldari Tribal is scrambling everything we have, but the Scorch Apostle's escort fleet is massive. You will spearhead the assault. Destroy the escort fleet, disable the Duskwing before it can fire, and protect Audesder. Those people have already survived slavery. They will not die to pirate ambition.
