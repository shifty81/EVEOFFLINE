# EVE OFFLINE Requirements

# Core dependencies
# No external dependencies needed for basic functionality
# Python standard library is sufficient for MVP

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features
# For Python 3.14+, use pygame-ce (pygame community edition) which has better compatibility
# For Python 3.13 and below, use regular pygame with pre-built wheels
pygame>=2.5.0,<3.0.0; python_version < "3.14"     # For 2D graphics (use pre-built wheels)
pygame-ce>=2.4.0; python_version >= "3.14"        # Community edition for Python 3.14+
panda3d>=1.10.13         # For 3D graphics (Phase 5)
# numpy>=1.24.0          # For vector math
# pyglet>=2.0.0          # Alternative graphics library

# Development dependencies
pylint>=2.17.0           # Code quality and linting
flake8>=6.0.0            # Style guide enforcement
