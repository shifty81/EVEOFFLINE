# EVE OFFLINE - Visual and GUI Capabilities

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ What's Implemented (Text-Based)

#### Console Output Features
All visual feedback is currently delivered through **text-based console output** using Python's standard `print()` function with Unicode symbols and formatting.

#### 1. Ship Status Display
- Hull/Armor/Shield HP with current/max values
- Capacitor levels and recharge rates
- Ship class, name, and race information
- CPU and PowerGrid usage/capacity
- Signature radius and scan resolution
- Velocity and position coordinates

**Example Output:**
```
Ship: Vexor (Gallente Cruiser)
Hull:     450/450 HP  ████████████████████  100%
Armor:    500/500 HP  ████████████████████  100%
Shield:   600/600 HP  ████████████████████  100%
Capacitor: 350/350 GJ ████████████████████  100%
```

#### 2. Module Fitting Information
- Installed modules per slot (High/Mid/Low/Rig)
- Module stats (DPS, damage type, optimal range)
- Resource consumption (CPU/PowerGrid)
- Active/passive module status

**Example Output:**
```
High Slots (4):
  [1] 150mm Light AutoCannon I - 35 DPS (Explosive/Kinetic)
  [2] Empty
Mid Slots (4):
  [1] 1MN Afterburner I - +150% max velocity
  [2] X5 Enduring Stasis Webifier - 60% velocity reduction
```

#### 3. Drone Operations
- Drone bay contents and bandwidth usage
- Active drones in space
- Drone engagement status
- Individual drone HP and damage output

**Example Output:**
```
Drone Bay: 5 drones available
Bandwidth: 75/75 Mbit/s

Active Drones (5):
  • Hammerhead I x5 - Engaging Serpentis Scout
    HP: 100/100 | DPS: 28 each
```

#### 4. Combat Information
- Enemy ship details (class, name, faction)
- Distance to targets

- Basic UI elements
- Clickable interface
- Visual representation of ships and space
- HUD overlay with status information

**Phase 3+** may include:
- More advanced 3D rendering
- Better visual effects
- Polished UI/UX
- Modding support for custom graphics
- Performance optimizations

### 📸 The "White Screen" Issue

**Why does it appear as a white screen?**

Since there is **no GUI framework** implemented, when someone runs the client:
1. The client connects to the server (text output to console)
2. Game state updates are received (text output to console)
3. The `render()` method only prints text to console
4. **No window is created** - only console/terminal output exists

If someone expected a graphical window and saw a "white screen," it's likely:
- They ran a client but only saw an empty console window
- The console output scrolled by too quickly to see
- They expected a GUI window that doesn't exist yet
- A terminal emulator showed a blank screen

### 🎯 Current "Visual" Gameplay Experience

Players interact with the game by:
1. **Reading text output** in the console
2. **Typing commands** in interactive demo mode
3. **Viewing status updates** as text displays
4. **Following combat** through text descriptions
5. **Navigating menus** through numbered options

**Example Gameplay Session:**
```
$ python interactive_demo.py

### 🚀 Getting Visual Output

**To see current visual output:**

1. **Interactive Demo** (best for exploring features):
   ```bash
   python interactive_demo.py
   ```

2. **Automated Showcase** (see all features demonstrated):
   ```bash
   python showcase_gameplay.py
   ```

3. **Multiplayer Client** (networked text display):
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   python server/server.py
   
   # Terminal 2
   python client/client.py "YourName"
   ```

All of these provide **text-based visual feedback** in the console.
